For Rust-Analyzer to not throw a fit for monorepo of crates, 
create root level Cargo.toml, and define workspace with reference to every cargo crate related:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html

Defining workspaces in this way means that profiles for the non root package will be ignored, and we must specify profiles at the workspace root.
e.g. [profiles.release] in Cargo.toml at root instead of actors/actor/Cargo.toml

Must create Cargo.lock at root as well. Must make sure directories defined in workspace contain Crates.
`run cargo generate-lockfile`

Modify actions for actor and provider referenced from:

https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/TEMPLATE_provider.yml
